The following steps outline the process of giving inputs yourself to install. Please note that this application is only for installation purposes and is not responsible for further problems that may arise in downloading bepinex binaries, game issues starting up the game, or no compatible mod version available for the current base game.

Step 1. You will be prompted to enter the path to your among us folder which you will copy paste in. The folder must have base game files in it. The folder path can be found as followed:
![C__Program Files_Epic Games_AmongUs 12_8_2022 10_01_06 PM (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91138333/206843207-c767c99e-6562-425a-b1ad-f11be36a13f6.jpg)

Similarly, you may enter a 2nd path if you wish, this one is required to be a empty folder or will create one (ie ```Desktop\\mod``` may not exist yet but a empty directory named ```mod``` will be made on desktop). If you enter 1 path only, the mod will be installed there. If you give 2 paths, files from the first folder will be copied to the 2nd, and the mod will be installed at the second. This allows for making a copy of the base game somewhere else like desktop and having the mod there.

note: epic players cannot sign in from folders that arent the one displayed when installing the base game. However keeping a copy is still useful. When there is a update, allow epic games to update the game, then go to program files/epic games/among us and delete the contents. Now copy paste the files from your copy to the epic folder. You will be able to sign in and play once again. This is a useful and nice alternative due to not being able to actually downgrade on epic unlike steam.

Step 2: Use the up and down arrow keys to select the mod you want to install, it will be highlighted blue, click ```enter```, write ```y``` or ```n``` and click ```enter``` to confirm

The zip will start to be downloaded and after it will be extracted and set up in the designated folder. Please be patient as zips can be quite large and your internet speed is taken into consideration. 

After finishing it will prompt if you want to save your inputs as a preset right now and then show all the actions again. You may act accordingly at this point.
