## Modinstaller
A small application that installs the Among Us mod [town of us](https://github.com/eDonnes124/Town-Of-Us-R) with minimal user interaction

# How it works
- A user inputs the file path to the folder to install the mod - this is the only thing they have to do
- The program fetches the latest download link and version number from the github repo's API
- The zip is downloaded, extracted, and contents are set up in the folder without further input

# Usage
Refer to the [latest release](https://github.com/whichtwix/Modinstaller/releases/latest) to know what to do
